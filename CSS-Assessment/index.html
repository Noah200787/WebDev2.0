      <h2>Treaty One</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 150%">
        Treaty 1 (also known as the "Stone Fort Treaty") is an agreement
        established on August 3, 1871, between the Imperial Crown of Great
        Britain and Ireland and the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree nations. The
        first of a series of treaties called the Numbered Treaties that occurred
        between 1871–1921, this accord has been held to be essentially about
        peace and friendship. However, the eight days of treaty-making ended
        with the indigenous groups agreeing to "cede, release, surrender and
        yield up to Her Majesty the Queen and successors forever all the lands"
        in southern Manitoba to the Crown, in exchange for an annual annuity and
        material goods such as clothing and agricultural supplies. Within a year
        of the agreement, however, the indigenous communities approached the
        Canadian government declaring that a number of the items promised, which
        would become known as the “Outside Promises”, within the treaty had not
        been handed over to them yet, although subjects of the Crown continued
        to settle the land-based upon the agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875,
        a council of the federal government passed an order stating that it must
        be ensured that all of the Outside Promises were to be fulfilled and
        considered a part of the main agreements within Treaty 1.[3] However,
        due to the different intentions and understandings of the Canadian
        officials and the indigenous communities at the time of its creation,
        this treaty continues to be considered controversial well into the 21st
        century.

      <h2>What Land does treaty One cover</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 150%">
        The land encompassed by Treaty 1 includes Winnipeg, Brandon, Portage La
        Prairie, Selkirk, Steinbach, Grand Beach, Emerson, Winkler and many
        more. According to Dr. Laramee, if you're living on or visiting treaty
        land you should be familiar with the treaty that encompasses it. That
        goes for everyone – Indigenous or not.
