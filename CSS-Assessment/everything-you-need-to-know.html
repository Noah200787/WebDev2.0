        We are the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and Nehiyaw (Cree) original peoples of
        the territory of present-day southern Manitoba, including the Forks at
        the Assiniboine and Red rivers which was a vital trade and gathering
        site. Treaty One Nation is composed of the seven First Nations who are
        signatories to the first of the numbered Treaties, originally signed on
        August 3, 1871 at Lower Fort Garry after several days of discussions and
        ceremonies. The leadership of the seven Nations form the governing
        council of the Treaty One Nation
